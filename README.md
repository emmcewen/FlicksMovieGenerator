# Flicks Movie Randomizer

## Description

Are you tired of spending so much time having to flip through all of your different streaming services to try to find a good movie to watch? With this website, all you have to do is select the drop down arrow and pick one of the genres listed and it will populate 5 random movies for you. Each includes a brief description of the movie as well as the IMDB rating. If you decide you want to watch a different genre instead, all you have to do is select a new genre from the drop down and it will populate another 5 movies for you. The next time you visit the website, it will remind you which movie genre you last searched.

Our motivation behind this website was to give people an easier way to search for a movie to watch. It helps save time scrolling through hundreds of movies between all the different streaming services. We used 3 API's to pull all the data we needed to acheive this.
